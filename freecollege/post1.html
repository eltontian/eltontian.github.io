                    <p>“America’s College Promise” is presented as a plan aimed at helping lower income students by making college more affordable. Because our economy is more advanced, more jobs require more technical or vocational competency then before. Without access to secondary education, low-income students are at a disadvantage in the job market right from the start. Obama hopes to expand the universality of secondary education to all students.</p>
                    <p>One concern about “America’s College Promise” is that, in reality, it targets middle/upper class students more than lower class students. Upper and middle class students seem to benefit the most from the “last dollar” funding methods, since these students will receive funding when they normally would not. A better approach to apply the funding would be to distribute it based on income. A program, called <a href= "http://www.brookings.edu/research/opinions/2015/01/20-obama-free-community-college-bad-idea-sotu-butler">Pell Grants</a> already utilizes an income awareness application process. However, it’s also important to consider the max Pell Grant is $5,700 for a student, which is not extensive.</p>

                    <p>Additionally critics of Obama’s proposal also point out that the plan only covers tuition, which is around $3,000. However, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/william-b-bradshaw/the-presidents-plan-for-t_b_6492028.html">the cost to attend community college is estimated to be $16,000</a>. The rest of the costs include: $1,328 for books and supplies, $1,735 for transportation, $2,210 for miscellaneous expenses, and $7,705 for housing and food.Critics argue that Obama’s proposal is not extensive enough because many low-income students would still not be able to afford community college, since most of its costs lies outside of the tuition. </p>

<p>Even now, there is a phenomenon called undermatching where high performing low-income students do not apply to competitive schools where they would be academically fit. These students settle for less competitive schools and community colleges. It’s estimated that about <a href="http://media.collegeboard.com/digitalServices/pdf/nosca/collegekeys-brief-getting-into-college-postsecondary-undermatch.pdf">40% of high school students undermatch</a>.  However, with “America’s College Plan” undermatching could become a bigger problem because community colleges would be more accessible than more challenging four-year programs. </p>

	
                    <p>Also considering income tiers we also should examine how the program is being funded. One way Obama plans to fund his new program is by imposing taxes on the <a href="http://mediamatters.org/research/2015/01/23/what-media-miss-on-the-tax-breaks-in-obamas-fre/202247">529 college savings plan</a>. The 529 plan lets families save money in a tax deferred account. However, the 529 plan benefits the wealthy more; people who earn over $100,000 receive 6 times the tax break from the 529 plan then people who earn under $100,000. In fact, people who use the 529 plan have a median income of $142,000. Therefore, by taxing the 529 plan, Obama is bridging the income disparity a little bit by taking from the rich and giving more to the poor. </p>
