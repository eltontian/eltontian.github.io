                <h2>What is "America's College Promise"?</h2>
                <p>Behind great development are flaws. With income disparities becoming more and more threatening, we must reconsider the fundamental pieces that make up our economy. In the United States, one of these pieces is secondary education. Because of our growing, competitive economy, our <a href= "https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/01/09/fact-sheet-white-house-unveils-america-s-college-promise-proposal-tuitio">secondary education has become more and more important for success</a>. However, the cost of attending secondary education has been rising every year. Paying for tuition has become a barrier for many students, and has put a damper to our claim of equal opportunities in America.</p>
                <p>In his speech given at Pellissippi State Community College, Barack Obama addressed this growing problem in his controversial proposal, which would soon be coined as "<a href="http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2015/01/09/president-obama-announces-plan-for-tuition-free-community-college">America’s College Promise</a>." In his proposal, college students would be guaranteed two years of free community college, making secondary education as free and universal as high school is now. Community colleges are colleges primarily serving local students and are funded by local and state governments.	Students must attend at least half-time and maintain a 2.5 GPA to be qualified for the program. </p>
                <p>The federal government would cover about three quarters of the cost while Obama called upon states to cover the rest. Obama revealed that the program would cost the federal government $60 billion over the next ten years. According to the White House, 9 million students could benefit from “America’s College Promise” saving potentially $3,800 per year. The majority of students who will benefit are students who do not receive enough financial aid, which is why experts in the field has called the plan the “last dollar” funding method.</p>
                <p>This program is not original; the Promise is modeled after a program already in place in Tennessee. Named “Tennesee’s Promise,” the program offers free community college to those maintaining a 3.0 GPA and who are full-time students, all funded by <a href="http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2015/01/09/president-obama-announces-plan-for-tuition-free-community-college">Tennessee</a>.</p> 
                <p>“America’s College Promise” is coming under wide scrutiny as Obama attempts to push it through Congress in these next few weeks. How do you feel about “America’s College Promise”?</p>
