                <h2>What is "America's College Promise"?</h2>
                <p>In his speech given at Pellissippi State Community College, Barack Obama proposed his controversial proposal, which would soon be coined as "<a href="http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2015/01/09/president-obama-announces-plan-for-tuition-free-community-college">America’s College Promise</a>." In his proposal, college students would be guaranteed two years of free community college, making secondary education as free and universal as high school is now. Students must attend at least half-time and maintain a 2.5 GPA to be qualified for the program. The federal government would cover about three quarters of the cost while Obama called upon states to cover the rest. Obama revealed that the program would cost the federal government $60 billion over the next ten years. According to the White House, 9 million students could benefit from “America’s College Promise” saving potentially $3,800 per year. The majority of students who will benefit are students who do not receive enough financial aid, which is why experts in the field has called the plan the “last dollar” funding method.</p>
                <p>This program is not original; the Promise is modeled after a program already in place in Tennessee. Named “Tennesee’s Promise,” the program offers free community college to those maintaining a 3.0 GPA and who are full-time students, all funded by <a href="http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2015/01/09/president-obama-announces-plan-for-tuition-free-community-college">Tennessee</a>.</p> 
                <p>Obama hopes to expand the universality of secondary education because America’s economy is more and more becoming restrictive to students with a college education.  As our economy grows and becomes more competitive, jobs that require an associate degree or higher are projected to grow twice as fast as jobs that require no college experience.  In order to increase our population’s job readiness, a college education is necessary. A more educated populous is not only beneficial to the economy but to society as well. Community colleges are colleges primarily serving local students and are funded by local and state governments. </p>
                <p>Still, there are many critics to Obama’s plan who question the funding and effectiveness of the plan.</p>
