                    <p>“America’s College Promise” was formulated under the basis that community college is beneficial to students, but is it really?</p>

<p>All statistics point that it is in student’s best interest to attend college. 
    According to the <a href = "http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2014/02/11/the-rising-cost-of-not-going-to-college/">Pew Research Center</a>, college graduates at the age of 25 to 32 earn on average $17,500 per year more than young adults without a college degree. College graduates are also less likely to be unemployed by a factor of 300%. It stands to reason that college teaches job applicable skills and provides career networking opportunities that you can’t find elsewhere. Having a college degree helps ensure success later in life, and it also protects against poverty. An adult without any college education is twice as likely to find himself in poverty than an adult with some college education. Education advocates emphasize that a college degree can be the equalizer of socioeconomic class hierarchy and can provide the opportunity for students to move across different socioeconomic classes.</p>

<p> Statistics show a strong correlation between higher wages and higher degrees, but it’s impossible to determine the true cause of these higher wages. Are colleges equipping students with applicable skills, or is there a lurking variable we have not considered? Perhaps students who attend college represent the higher performing percentage of the population, and therefore can attribute their success to their inherent ability rather than attending college. </p>

                    <p>Some argue that community college is completely ineffective. <a href = "http://www.brookings.edu/research/opinions/2015/01/20-obama-free-community-college-bad-idea-sotu-butler">20% of students in a community college complete the two-year degree within three years. And it’s not an effective gateway to a 4-year college degree either. Less than 15% of community college students earn a bachelor’s degree within 6 years</a>. Many education reformists say the community college is not effective. Despite how many opportunities a community college offers, many college students don’t take advantage of them. A large portion of college students comes to college and party more often than they study. If we decrease the barrier of getting into college we only decrease the costs of not only partying but also dropping out. With the proposed plan, students would have less investment in their education. </p>
                    <p>Before we invest in $60 billion of our tax money in an institution, we should validate the effectiveness of the institution first.</p>
