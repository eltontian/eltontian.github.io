                    <p>Although “America’s College Promise” is targeted to help lower classes, the plan helps the whole society.</p>

                    <p>First off by promoting lower income classes to attend college, you increase the diversity of the college population, since minorities are unfairly represented across income classes. Also since college allows for movement within income classes, it allows for the opportunity to level the distribution of minorities among income classes. </p> 

                    <p>Right now, over 9 million Americans are employed, yet <a href = "http://qz.com/325442/obamas-free-community-college-program-can-really-land-you-a-high-paying-job/">“4.8 million jobs remain unfilled, because there simply isn’t a big enough pool of applicants who possess the right practical, technical, and job-ready skills to do the work companies need.”</a>  If we provide these skills we could close out the skill gap in our economy and reduce unemployment and poverty at the same time.</p>

                    <p>Considering college graduates earn <a href = "http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2014/02/11/the-rising-cost-of-not-going-to-college/">$17,500</a> more on average than non-college graduates, by providing access to college to everybody, we can increase the overall income in America. In fact, according to the <a href = "http://www.ihep.org/sites/default/files/uploads/docs/pubs/reapingthebenefits.pdf">Institute for Higher Education Policy</a>, a higher income and job consistency leads to higher contributions to tax revenues, greater economical productivity, higher consumption rate, and reduced reliance on government financial support. Considering the multiplier effect, a rise in income across the population benefits the community multiple times over. </p>

                    <p>However, the benefits don’t just end there. According to Institute for Higher Education Policy, there are secondary benefits of secondary education as well. They found that benefits include reduced crime rates, higher voter turnout rates and more social cohesion. Secondary education produces more involved and positive citizens. </p>

                    <p>“America’s College Promise” does not only impact low-income students. Many economists explain that such a policy affects the whole economy. Secondary education is a fundamental piece to society and the economy because it assists the transition from dependents to fully functioning citizens. Once students become citizens they impact society directly, which is why many argue that it is important to educate them on how to function in a way that they impact society positively.</p>

                    <p>Yet others are still concerned about the costs of such a policy. Besides the 529 tax plan, the government still has not disclosed how they will fund “America’s College Promise.”  But considering the 9 million students that could benefit from the plan, the government could potentially be paying <a href = "http://hotair.com/archives/2015/01/09/next-big-obama-agenda-item-free-community-%20college/">34 billion</a> a year to accommodate these students. The estimate given by Barack Obama underestimates the necessary costs immensey. The funding must come from somewhere, and a rise in taxes seems to be the prime suspect. If taxes cripple the economy’s disposable income, then the plan contradicts the goals and missions it sets.</p>
