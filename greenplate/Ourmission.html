				<h1><center>Our Mission</center></h1>
				<p><h3><font color = "red"><center>Since we intend to be working directly with the Food recovery Network, This spot will be filled with their mission statement. Currently we do not own rights and therfore inputting such a thing right now would be considered academic dishonesty, but here is a sample statement we have prepared.</center></font></h3></p>
				<p><h3><font color = "green"><center>Our goal here wiht Green Plate is to fix an already dire situation involving food that is left over and eventually discarded as waste. We intend to work directly with local resturants and encourage donation of excess food that would be thrown out to local food banks that will redistribute the food to the lower income families of our community. This will not only bolster our environmental safety but also help our local community. Though this is only a local project right now, there are hopes that this could be expanded to a more inclusive system in the future.</center></font></h3></p>
